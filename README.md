# The Odin Project JS Final Project: Basic Reddit Clone

I created this app as my final project for the JavaScript track of The Odin Project.
This is a Reddit clone that contains its basic core functionality: CRUD functionality for subs/posts/comments, allow users to create an account and keep track of their own subs/posts/comments, as well as any favorites or upvoted/downvoted content.
